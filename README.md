Repository for Supercollider powered Raspberry Pi programmable portable synthesizer.

Current State:  Currently this mess runs on osx and will soon be tested on windows.  All of the code needed to run the interface and the supercollider server is in the note-expansion branch.  It has yet to be merged back to the master branch.
