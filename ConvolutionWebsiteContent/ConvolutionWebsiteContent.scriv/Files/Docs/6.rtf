\f0\fs28 \cf0 The project is built around the Raspberry Pi, the Arduino (the SAMD21 version), SuperCollider (a language built specifically built for audio processing and synthesis), and Processing. The interface consists of 6 potentiometers, 24 pads (capacitive touch) split into 8 \'93function\'94 pads and 16 pads to control instrument, two rotary encoders with push buttons, and the official Raspberry Pi 7\'94 Touch Screen.  \
\
The Arduino processes and sends all of the interface data to the Raspberry Pi using OSC (Open Sound Control) style messages.  On the Raspberry Pi the Processing sketch has 3 jobs: listening for messages from the Arduino, creating the interface, and sending OSC messages to Supercollider.  SuperCollider runs an audio server on the Raspberry PI handling all audio tasks.}
